# TAP Query History via UWS

```{abstract}
A requirement for the RSP and in particular the portal is providing users the ability to view their past queries and possibly interact with them, for example by re-running, storing or sharing with others.
This note describes a proposed approach to address this functionality via the use of the “jobs” API  which is part of the UWS standard and available via the CADC TAP service.
